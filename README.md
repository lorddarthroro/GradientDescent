# GradientDescent
My own implementation of Gradient Descent. It's worth noting that the sample set I included doesn't seem to fit super well with gradient descent. While the error certainly goes down for the set, the error (MSE) is still pretty large after 10000 iterations, but this just may be a limitation of the data features for predicting the target.
If you want to use this yourself, you can just replace the file with your own and drop whichever columns you need to. The way the code is written, it will make the last column the target, and the rest of the columns the features.
